### CPSC 120L

>  Lab 7, Part 1

Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs to work on, as it helped me really grasp the whole idea of if conditions. Helping me understand how logical operators can be used within the conditions. And helping me understand, at least better, how things like parking rules can be translated into coding, giving functionality to concepts and designs.

> Lab 8, part 2

Lab 8 was another lab that I particularly enjoyed working on, specifically in part 2, where we were asked to create a pattern with loops. At first, I was a bit wary about where to start, as it looked like a lot, by breaking it down into how it could be done with loops. It really got me curious about what other types of patterns can be created, like instead of being a rectangle, it could be an equilateral triangle.

> Lab 11, part 2

Lab 11, part 2, was a favorite due to its help in understanding OOP and using I/O to perform the task at hand. During the lab, you apply both I/O and classes in order to return information about the densest and sparsest states in the US by comparing each state's object value to each other using if conditions, which is read from a CSV file. This lab showed me how data can be used to get certain information that can be curated to give specific information that can be deemed important, essentially just getting a better understanding of real-world applications.
